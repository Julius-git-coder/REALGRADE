Classroom Management System
Overview
This project is a Classroom Management System designed to allow an admin to send exercises, projects, assignments, and announcements to students. The admin can send these to all students at once or to a specific student based on their registered email. Each student has a personalized page where they can view the content sent to them.
Features

Admin Capabilities:
Send exercises, projects, assignments, and announcements to all students.
Select a specific student by their registered email to send targeted content.
Send content to all students simultaneously by selecting the "All" option.


Student Experience:
Each student has a personal page displaying exercises, projects, assignments, and announcements sent to them.
Content is delivered based on the student's registered email.


Email-Based System:
Students sign up with their email, which the admin uses to identify and send content to individual students.
